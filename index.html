				<h2>3-3 Joseki</h2>sansan
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>The 3-3 point emphasizes territory and speed (settling the corner in one move) over influence. Its
					weakness is the lack of obvious local follow ups.
					The number of 3-3 point josekis is very limited, so they are easy to learn. It aims for a close and
					complicated (i.e. fighting) game without big territories, where the corner territory secured with
					the 3-3 point may prove decisive. It is particularly popular for white as komi is a bigger advantage
					when neither player has much territory.

				<h2>3-4 Joseki</h2>komoku
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>The 3-4 point (aka komoku or 'small eye') emphasizes a balance of territory and influence. It looks
					forward to development along one side of the board and/or forming a corner enclosure. For many
					centuries, the 3-4 point has been the most common way to start a game. In modern go, it is one of
					the most popular openings and is well-regarded by strong AI programs like
					AlphaGo. </p>

				<h2>4-4 Joseki</h2>hoshi
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>The 4-4 point (aka hoshi or 'star point') emphasizes influence, speed, and flexibility. Compared with
					the 3-4 point or 3-3 point, the corner can still be invaded and the territory is not secure. In
					modern go, it is one of the most popular openings and preferred by strong AI
					programs like AlphaGo. </p>
