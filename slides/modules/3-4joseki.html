    <p>The 3-4 point (aka komoku or 'small eye') emphasizes a balance of territory and influence. It looks
        forward to development along one side of the board and/or forming a corner enclosure. For many
        centuries, the 3-4 point has been the most common way to start a game. In modern go, it is one of
        the most popular openings and is well-regarded by strong AI programs like
        AlphaGo. </p>
