        <h2>4-4 Joseki</h2>hoshi
</section>
<section>
        <p>The 4-4 point (aka hoshi or 'star point') emphasizes influence, speed, and flexibility. Compared with
                the 3-4 point or 3-3 point, the corner can still be invaded and the territory is not secure. In
                modern go, it is one of the most popular openings and preferred by strong AI
                programs like AlphaGo. </p>

                <p>The simple extension emphasizes taking sente. While it may not be the strongest local response,
                        forming a three-stone wall is good shape and resilient, so it can be a good choice if Black
                        intends to tenuki. </p>

                <p>In 2019 and 2021, it was the most popular joseki in professional games. The purpose of choosing this
                        joseki is to take sente elsewhere on the board
                        while creating a stable group. </p>

                <p>The most common choice by
                        Black is to tenuki, because Black has a relatively settled shape and various local moves
                        like C, D, and sometimes E to handle the group. So it’s difficult for White to attack Black’s
                        wall.</p>

                <p>Black wants to build in the direction of the right side, so it is also natural for
                        Black to play the next move somewhere on that side, like A or B.</p>

                <p>Extending further than A or B is also suggested, since in modern go theory, extensions from thick and
                        established walls should be aggressive.

                <p>Black takes the corner in gote (about 10 points). The captured stones leave a lot of aji if White
                        continues with A or B.</p>
