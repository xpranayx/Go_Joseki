        <h2>4-4 Joseki</h2>hoshi
</section>
<section>
        <p>The 4-4 point (aka hoshi or 'star point') emphasizes influence, speed, and flexibility. Compared with
                the 3-4 point or 3-3 point, the corner can still be invaded and the territory is not secure. In
                modern go, it is one of the most popular openings and preferred by strong AI
                programs like AlphaGo. </p>
