    <h2>3-3 Joseki</h2>sansan

    <p>The 3-3 point emphasizes territory and speed (settling the corner in one move) over influence. Its
        weakness is the lack of obvious local follow ups.
        The number of 3-3 point josekis is very limited, so they are easy to learn. It aims for a close and
        complicated (i.e. fighting) game without big territories, where the corner territory secured with
        the 3-3 point may prove decisive. It is particularly popular for white as komi is a bigger advantage
        when neither player has much territory.

        <p>In this joseki, White is making outside influence, while Black goes for the corner territory.
            Next, the jump at 6, continuing to emphasize the outside, is White's most common move.</p>
